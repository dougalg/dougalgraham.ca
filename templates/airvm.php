    <p>Hi, my name is Dougal Graham.</p>

    <p>I am a former teacher and computational linguist, who's always had a passion for technology and web development.</p>

    <p>I have just returned to Montreal from Thailand, and am looking for a place where I can settle down and spend my time making great web software. (As a native Newfoundlander I'd love to relocate to the maritimes)</p>

    <h2>Fitting In</h2>
    <p>I love learning new technologies, and enjoy a bit of <a target="_new" href="//github.com/dougalg">coding</a> <a target="_new" href="//colortext.tfiaa.com">in my free time</a> as well. Initially I learned object-oriented PHP while working at WAMSB, but once I first saw Python, I had to learn it. Now, I am comfortable programming in both langauges, and considering trying out Ruby.</p>

    <p>Similarly, I've made it a point to always have an understanding of all the technologies involved in web development from Apache and Lighttpd setups, to MySQL, to both back and front-end coding languages. These days, I'm working on improving my Javascript development skills and learning to work with SVG.</p>

    <p>I normally develop on a Mac, and spending a lot of time in the terminal, so I think I'll be right at home on Unix.</p>

    <h2 id="work">My Work</h2>

    <p>My most complex project to date, CEEM, was the creation of a specialized learning website for Thai students studying engineering in English.</p>

    <p>Take a look at some of the things I did there...</p>

        <div class="no-js">Turn on Javascript to see four more images. Or, visit <a href="http://crs2.kmutt.ac.th/ceem">CEEM</a> to see the site in action!</div>

        <div class="gallery-item" data-image="images/portfolio/ceem-gallery/sight_words.png" data-caption="A high-speed reading game"><img src="images/portfolio/ceem-gallery/sight_words.png"></div>

        <div class="gallery-item" data-caption="A difficult phrase-matching drag-and-drop test" data-image="images/portfolio/ceem-gallery/phrase_challenge.png"></div>

        <div class="gallery-item" data-caption="The student area is fully bilingual in Thai and English" data-image="images/portfolio/ceem-gallery/thai-english.png"></div>

        <div class="gallery-item" data-caption="A hangman game with keystroke capture" data-image="images/portfolio/ceem-gallery/hangman.png"></div>

        <div class="gallery-item" data-caption="Interactive list of important Engineering words" data-image="images/portfolio/ceem-gallery/word_list.png"></div>

        <div class="gallery-item" data-caption="Word details show sample phrases and similar words" data-image="images/portfolio/ceem-gallery/word_list_details.png"></div>

        <div class="gallery-footer">A high-speed reading game</div>
    </div>

    <p>To create interactive activities, I used AJAX and JSON to quickly load new data and keep the activities moving smoothly.</p>

    <h2>What I'd like to do</h2>

    <p>Right now I'm looking to join a company that is working hard to create excellent products where I can learn about developing software in a team, get exposure to new ways of doing things, and hopefully be able to share some of my own ideas.</p>

    <p>Specifically, I would be very interested in working in development of your RESTful api. API development is an area in which I think I could make a useful contribution. On a small scale, I have developed REST apis for several websites I have worked on to facilitate administration via AJAX+JSON, and I'd love to move up to a larger scale.</p>

    <p>I really look forward to hearing from you, and would be happy to talk with you any time. If there's anything you'd like to know about me, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailt:dougalg@gmail.com">get in touch</a>.
