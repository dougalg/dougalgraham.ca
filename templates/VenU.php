    <p>Hi, my name is Dougal Graham.</p>
    <p>I am a former teacher and current web developer from St. John's Newfoundland. I think that VenU is a place where I can not only put my skills to use, but also grow as a developer.</p>

    <h2>Why I fit</h2>
    <p>I have proven experience developing a variety of websites over the past several years. Not only am I familiar with implementing PSD designs in HTML and CSS, but I am also familiar with developing complex web applications in both PHP and Python.</p>

    <p>Almost as importantly, my experience as a teacher and developer of learning software makes me especially suited to be able to help VenU as more than just a simple web developer. I am extremely interested in online learning, having developed a responsive online learning application for the study of English.</p>

    <h2>Why VenU is special</h2>
    <p>You are trying to use technology to make learning easier, and better. As an educator, this is something that I strongly believe in. I feel that ability to learn is the most important skill one can master, and atempting to help another achieve their potential is a noble goal.</p>

    <p>You believe in a self-directed work force who can work from home or with flexible hours. I love this not only because it means you believe in your employees and that you are a progressive business, but also because it means I don't need to commute as someone with strong feelings about the environment, this really appeals me.</p>

    <h2>My Work</h2>

    <p>CEEM is a fully responsive online language learning plaform for English as a Second/Foreign Language learners to learn engineering English. I used Python to manage the data, and set up a small JSON API to make the data accessible by AJAX to the frontend.</p>

    <p>To boost student engagement, I tried to make activities that were fast-moving, using Javascript and AJAX to reduce response-times and keep the activities interactive.</p>

    <h2>How can I help?</h2>

    <h3>Classroom management software</h3>
    <p>Classroom management requires clarity of layout and a lot of database interaction. Using AJAX, and semantic HTML and CSS, as I have done in the past, I believe that I could contribute strongly to making updates to the classroom management interface clear, easy to use, and responsive across a variety of devices.</p>

    <h3>Dashboard Reporting</h3>
    <p>This is an area where I hope I could have a chance to expand my skills. I do not have experience with layout out graphics and charts in HTML/SVG/Javascript. I'm not sure what technique you use to display the charts, but I hope it is SCG+Javascript! If it is, I would really enjoy the chance to take my skills to another level by working on this part of your software.</p>
